        <p>A contract is an agreement entered into by two or more persons with the intention of creating a legal obligation or obligations.</p>
        
        <p>All contracts should have at least to person as party to the contract.</p>
        
        <p>Therefore a contract is bilateral, i.e a mininmum of two people are party to the contract. A contract can also be multilateral, meaning there are more than two parties to the contract.</p>
        
 <p>By its nature a contract is an undertaking between two or more parties to create an obligation or obligations between the parties.</p>
        
<p>For the obligations the parties wish to create to be contractually binding, certain requirements need to be fullfilled.</p>
 
        <p>These requirements will be discussed in detail below:</p>
    
        
  <ol>
    <li>Consensus</li>
    <li>Capacity</li>
    <li>Formalities</li>
    <li>Legality</li>
    <li>Possibility</li>
    <li>Certainty</li>
       
    
      </section>
      
        </div>
        
        <div>
        
      <section class="main-section" id="Consensus">
        <header>
          <h1>Consensus</h1>
        </header>
        
        <hr>
        
        <p>The requirement of consensus can be plainly put as "a meeting of the minds".</p>
        <p>In other words the parties to the contract must be in agreement on the material terms of the contract.</p>
        
        <p>The process of reaching the above agreement may either be long and drawn out or quick and easy. This depends on the parties.</p>
        
        <p>This involves the mutual declaration of the parties, regarding their intention/s. This can usually be analysed by rules of the offer and acceptance of the offer (this will be discussed seperately).</p>
        
        <p>Parties my express their intentions in any form of their choosing:</p>
          
         <ul>
           
           <li>Orally</li>
           <li>Written</li>
           <li>By way of conduct, etc.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>This is the case unless the law requires the intention to be in a specific form. This will be discussed in the Formalities section.</p>
        
        <p>Taking the above into account, it becomes clear that if one of the parties to a contract is under  a different imperssion to the other, the contract is invalid, because the parties "minds did not meet" regarding the material aspects of the contract.</p>

          <h1>Capacity</h1>
        </header>
        
        <hr>
        
        <p>Not all person have the capacity to create, alter or destroy rights or duties through a juristic act.</p>
        
        <p> This is because capacity is at times limited by age or mental capacity.</p>
        
        <p>Minors can therefore not enter into legally binding contracts, without their parents/gaurdians, as they lack the capacity to do so.</p>
        
        <p>Persons with limited mental capacity can also not enter into legally binding contracts. This is to prevent people from taking advantage of disadvantaged people.</p>
        
        <p>Generally a person can only be declared legally mentally incapable  by a court of law, at which time a curator will be appointed.</p>
        
        <p>Depending on the extent of the mental incapacity a court will make an appropriate order, therefore depending on the court order certain people may enter into contracts without a curator.</p>

          <h1>Formalities</h1>
        </header>
        
        <hr>
        
        <p>Formalities are prescribed by statute.</p>
        
        <p>Therefore, depending on the material aspects of the contract, we have to observe different formalities.</p>
        
        <p>An example of this is that law requires a contract for the alienation of land (buying and selling land) be in writing.</p>
        
        <p>On the other hand, an employment contract need not be in writing, but can be done verbally.</p>
        
        <p>That being said, there is nothing in law that states an employment contract cannot be in writing, which is the smart thing to do, as it is easier to prove the existence of a contract between the parties when it is signed in black and white.</p>

        <header>
          <h1>Legality</h1>
        </header>
        
        <hr>
        
        <p>An underlying principle of of the law of contract is that agreements are seriously entered into and should be enforced.</p>
        
        <p>Keeping this in mind, it makes sense that one cannot enter into contract which creates obligations that are illegal.</p>
        
        <p>Logically one cannot use law to enforce performance which is illegal.</p>
        
        <p>Therefore the material aspects of a contract should be legal, otherwise the contract is not valid and legally enforceable.</p>
        
      </section>

        <div>
          
      <section class="main-section" id="Possibility">
        <header>
          <h1>Possibility</h1>
        </header>
        
        <hr>
        
        <p>With regard to Possibility we can operate under the general rule that "Impossibility of performance prevents the creation of obligations."
        </p>
        
        <p>Parties who agree to do the impossible have the intention to create obligations, but they labour under a common mistake as to the circumstances surrounding the conclusion of the contract.</p<
          
        <p>This will most of the time render the contract void.</p>
        
        <p> Therefore parties can only enter into a valid contract if the obligations they seek to create are possible.</p<

          <h1>Certainty</h1>
        </header>
        
        <hr>
        
        <p>The general rule regarding certainty is "Uncertainty about what has to be performed prevents the creation of obligations."</p>
        
        <p>Put simply, for the creation of contractual obligations, their contents must be certain or capable of being certain through mechanisms set out in the contract. </p>
